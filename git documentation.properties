### Git Commands for Committing and Pushing Changes

#### 1. Navigate to Your Project Folder
If you're not inside your project directory, open a terminal and navigate to it:
```
cd /path/to/your/project
```

#### 2. Check Git Status
To see which files have been modified or added:
```
git status
```

#### 3. Add All Changes
To stage all modified and new files for commit:
```
git add .
```

#### 4. Commit the Changes
To save the changes locally with a meaningful message:
```
git commit -m "Updated flashcard images to fill the card fully"
```

#### 5. Push to GitHub
Ensure you're on the correct branch (e.g., `main`) and push the changes:
```
git push origin main
```

### If This Is Your First Time Pushing (New Repository)
Before pushing, set up the remote repository:
```
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `your-username` and `your-repository` with your actual GitHub details.
